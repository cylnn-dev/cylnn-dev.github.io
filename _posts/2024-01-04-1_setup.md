## Traditions...

Writing a `"Hello, World!"` program is a time-honored [tradition][ancient_tradition] that continues to be relevant today. This simple program serves as a sanity check before diving into more complex tasks. It allows you to test your coding environment  and ensure everything is functioning correctly. Interestingly, some folks also consider  this program to be a harbinger of good luck.

Oh! Where are my manners? Here is a very quick setup tour to begin with. Moreover, Don't forget to check out [Mastering STM32][mastering_stm32]. This books is a good resource to familiarize with the STM32 environment and would be considered as one of the most comprehensive introductory book in the STM32 domain.

## Quick Setup Tour
* **`Compiler` and `MSYS2`:** Since we're using C as our primary language, you'll need a compiler, specifically [GCC][gcc]. 
  However, don't just download GCC by itself; opt for MSYS2 for a more complete environment. Even if you're not using Visual Studio, they offer a helpful [guide][msys_guide] for this setup.


* **Download and setup `CubeIDE`, `CubeMX`, and `CubeProgrammer`:** 
  * [CubeIDE][cube_ide]: Our base IDE for generating HAL codes.
  * [CubeMX][cube_mx]: Our configuration tool that will be our trusty companion throughout the project.
  * [CubeProgrammer][cube_programmer]: While CubeIDE is a valuable tool, it's based on the older Eclipse platform
    that has since gone open source. You might want to complement it with your favorite text editor or integrated
    development environment (IDE) for more modern development experiences.


* **Text Editor or IDE:** While CubeIDE is a valuable tool, it's based on the older Eclipse platform that has since
  gone open source. You might want to complement it with your favorite text editor or integrated development
  environment (IDE) for more modern development experiences.

**NOTE**

During my experimentation with various development tools, I would like to recommend you to stick 
with your favorite IDE. My favorite one is [Clion][clion] as it integrates well with CMake, in which I will use a 
template to automate CMake file during the projects.  However, for your convenience, you'll still need STM's 
software. For example, I generate codes using CubeIDE and then switch back to CLion. If configurations need 
adjustments, I can rely on CubeMX to assist me in the process.

## Creating the First Program
1. Launch `CubeIDE`
2. Go to `File > New > STM32 Project`.
3. In the target selection part, navigate to `Board Selector`.
4. Enter your _Commercial Part Number_ (for example, mine was `STM32F407G-DISC1`).
5. Select your board from the list.
6. Click `Next`.
7. Provide a `Project Name` and Click `Next`
8. In the `Code Generator Options`, choose the option that says `Copy only the necessary library files`.
9. Click `Finish`.
10. Ensure that the option to Initialize all peripherals with their `Default Mode` is set to **Yes**.


Now, you should see your Pinout Configuration tab in CubeIDE.

1. In **CubeIDE**, open the` Pinout Configuration` tab, which is opened by default. This tab displays your 
   microprocessor's default pin
   configuration, with some peripherals already configured and named for your convenience.
2. Check the `Clock Configuration` tab, where you'll find clock settings already configured.
3. Next, navigate to `Project Manager`, and on the **left-hand side**, select `Code Generator`.
4. In the On `Generated File` section, opt for `Generate peripheral initialization as a pair of '.c/.h' files per 
   peripheral`.

With these essentials in place and the recommended reading, you're well-equipped to embark on your embedded systems 
journey. Keep in mind that the following sections won't delve into every detail, but they'll provide you with a 
solid foundation.
