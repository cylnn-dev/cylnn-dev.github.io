# About Me

New graduate Electronics and Communication Engineer interested in machine learning and embedded systems.

## Purpose of this Website

This website aims to share the experience we gain throughout our journey. The internet provided me with resources that shaped who I am today. Now, it is payback time. I only share topics that I couldn't find readily available on the internet.
